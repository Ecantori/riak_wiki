[[Widescript|http://www.widescript.com]] is a digital reading application targeted to people who study or make use of reference material. It allows them to interact with their texts, everywhere. The development of the idea started in early 2010 and the application is currently in private beta. 

*From Lead Developer Francisco Treacy:* "As Riak is content-type agnostic and excels at consistency/availability fine-tuning, it is being used to persist several kinds of data in Widescript's application - logging, user metadata, multimedia assets. Not only it was chosen for its distributed nature, but because it goes hand in hand with Widescript's Javascript development stack."

Based in Seatlle, [[SwingVine|http://swingvine.com]] helps you discover new music, movies, books, fashion, wines, and more.

SwingVine then lets you personalize your discovery experience by incorporating your friends. 

*From Co-Founder Alan McConnell:* "We've had a fantastic experience using Riak for a media scrapbook product we've recently released called SwingVine Gallery. Our legacy image storage system is over 10K lines of C++ code, and using Riak we were able to replace it with a system that is less than 1000 lines of python and performs better, scales better, and is more durable.  All of our users' scrapbook media (video, images and audio) data/metadata for the SwingVine Gallery product is housed in Riak.

[[Rigel Group|http://rigelgroupllc.com]] is a small, high-impact software development company based in Carlsbad, CA. We help clients leverage cutting-edge technologies and cloud-based architectures to build high-performance, large-scale applications at absurdly low costs. 

*From Rigel Group CTO John Lynch:* "One of our favorite tools is the Riak distributed key/value data store. Riak's incredibly low operational costs allow clients who do not have dedicated, high-end system administration resources to still deploy large-scale, data-heavy applications. This "democratization" of Big Data is allowing smaller firms to compete with the big guys. Having a company as developer-friendly as Basho stand behind the product is also a huge win for us."

[[Division by Zero|http://overnothing.com/]] is a software consultancy based in New York state that specializes in Ruby/Rails application deployments, architecture & infrastructure planning consulting, and Web application Development.

*From Division by Zero Founder Wayne Seguin*: "One system we built integrates Postgresql, Redis and Riak as backends to several applications (including a few Ruby on Rails web applications). Postgresql is used for driving several E/R modeled applications from the same central database. Redis is used as a distributed queue system. And Riak is used for data sets that we do not want adding load to the master Postgresql database as well as for storing result sets as detailed below.

There are a several web and API applications that run off of the Postgresql database where entities and their relationships are stored. Agents run on many servers across multiple data centers. These agents submit data into a centralized Redis queue. Then several worker daemons process the data from the queues and update the database based on the information gained from the collected data.

There are many background processes (some services, some run run as cronjobs) which query the Postgresql database server in order to extract data sets, potentially very large.  These extracted data sets are stored in Riak. After the data sets are stored in the Riak system, there are several reporting / aggregating (long running) processes which load the data sets from Riak. The processes compute their results and then store them back in Riak either for further processing or for retrieval. Riak keys for the results are sent to the Postgresql system thus linking the Riak result sets with the Entities they are related to in Postgresql."
