Restarting a node after a failure may result in a slower than normal startup time. For example, an InnoDB backed node may need to perform a crash recovery on startup. The longer startup time associated with recovery may lead to other problems; [[bug #134|https://issues.basho.com/show_bug.cgi?id=134]], for example, describes an issue where Riak may begin sending requests (get, put, delete) to nodes before they are ready to accept requests. {excerpt}To avoid problems when recovering a failed node the following technique should be followed.{excerpt}

{info:title=Bug 134 - Node liveness}
[[The node liveness issue related to crash recovery|https://issues.basho.com/show_bug.cgi?id=134]] has been fixed in Riak 0.12.
{info}

A failed node can be re-introduced by starting the node in isolation, allowing it to stabilize, cleanly stopping it, and restarting it within the cluster.
# Bring up the riak node on the console with a different name
{code:bash}
./bin/riak console -name nonode@nohost
{code}
# Allow InnoDB to recover
{code}
InnoDB will output messages to the console during recovery. An example recovery
session may look as follows:
InnoDB: Mutexes and rw_locks use GCC atomic builtins
100610 12:09:58  InnoDB: highest supported file format is Barracuda.
InnoDB: Log scan progressed past the checkpoint lsn 205513
100610 12:09:58 InnoDB: Database was not shut down normally!
InnoDB: Starting crash recovery.
InnoDB: Reading tablespace information from the .ibd files...
InnoDB: Restoring possible half-written data pages from the doublewrite
InnoDB: buffer...
InnoDB: Doing recovery: scanned up to log sequence number 1836519

database...
