The local Erlang client is a tightly-integrated part of Riak and the Riak REST interface uses the Erlang client internally. You can find more information about the Erlang-native driver in the [[edoc API|http://riak.basho.com/edoc/index.html]].

The primary client for code that is not inside Riak is the PBC client:
