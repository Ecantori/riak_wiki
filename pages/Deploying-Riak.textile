h2. Access Control and Load Balancing 

Riak, much like many other databases, has no access control mechanisms built in. What this means is that you'll need to set up some sort of proxy server in front of your Riak cluster(s) in order to secure it. This is simple to put in place and has the added benefit of acting as a load balancer for your cluster.

There are various open source proxy servers that can used for this, such as [[Nginx|http://nginx.org/]], [[Squid|http://www.squid-cache.org/]], and [[Varnish|http://www.varnish-cache.org/]].
