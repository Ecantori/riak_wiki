h2. About Luwak

Luwak is an application built on top of Riak that provides functionality for managing large files. Luwak works by breaking large files into blocks and storing each block as a separate Riak object. Luwak is bundled with Riak, as of version 0.13, but disabled by default.

h2. Enabling Luwak

Luwak can be enabled in Riak's @app.config@ file. As of version 0.13 a new section has been added to the @app.config@ file for Luwak:

```bash
{luwak, [{enabled, false}]}
```


To enable Luwak set the "enabled" property to "true" and restart Riak:

```bash
{luwak, [{enabled, true}]}
```


h2. Configuring Luwak

Luwak, by default, is accessible from the @/luwak@ endpoint of Riak (i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8098/luwak). This endpoint is configurable via the "prefix" property in the Luwak section of @app.config@:

```bash
{luwak,
 [{enabled, true},
  {prefix, "different_luwak_prefix"}
]}
```

h2. Luwak Operations

The first thing you'll notice about the Luwak REST API is that there are no buckets; files are stored in a flat namespace. Other than the lack of buckets, the operations for storing an object are the same as Riak.
