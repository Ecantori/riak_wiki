h2. Installing Riak Search

The latest Search, unlike previous releases, is now bundled with Riak.  By default the Search functionality is not enabled.  Enabling Search is a simple matter of changing one line in Riak's "app.config":Configuration-Files.html#app.config file.

<div class="note">
  <div class="title">All or none</div>

  If you choose to enable Search it should be done for every node in the cluster.  That is, make sure to edit the @app.config@ for all nodes.
</div>

1. Search for the text *Riak Search Config* and then flip the enabled flag.

```erlang

{enabled, false}

```
to 

```erlang

{enabled, true}

```

When enabled, the Search portion of your app.config should look something like this:

```erlang


%% Riak Search Config
 {riak_search, [
                %% To enable Search functionality set this 'true'.
                {enabled, true}
               ]},
```

At this point you have a Search-capable Riak cluster.  Administering this cluster is no different then administering a stock Riak cluster, i.e. use @riak@ and @riak-admin@.  The Search specific commands are still invoked via @search-cmd@ which you can learn about on the "Schema":Riak-Search---Schema.html, "Indexing":Riak-Search---Indexing.html, and "Querying":Riak-Search---Querying.html pages.
