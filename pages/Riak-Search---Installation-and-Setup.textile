h2. Installing Riak Search

In order to enable the riak_search app in node, all you have to do is modify your "app.config file":http://wiki.basho.com/Configuration-Files.html#app.config to reflect it. 

1. When you get to your app.config, search for the text *Riak Search Config* and then simply change 

```erlang

{enabled, false}

```
to 

```erlang

{enabled, true}

```

When enabled, the Search portion of your app.config will should look like this:

```erlang


%% Riak Search Config
 {riak_search, [
                %% To enable Search functionality set this 'true'.
                {enabled, true}
               ]},
```

(_Keep in mind that you'll have to enable this on all the nodes in your cluster._)

After this is configured, start Riak from the appropriate directory with:

```erlang

riak start

```

You can then make sure it's running with:

```erlang

riak pong

```

If it responds with "pong", you've got Riak Search (and Riak) up and running.
