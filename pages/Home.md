Riak is the most powerful open-source, distributed database you'll ever put into production. Riak scales predictably and easily and simplifies development by giving users the ability to quickly prototype, test, and deploy their applications.  

Documentation for Riak can be found at the [Riak Wiki](http://wiki.basho.com/Riak.html).

## Other Basho Projects
<br>

Riak is our most-popular piece of code, but it’s by no means the only one. There are a whole series of libraries and applications that make Riak run, and we are dedicated to the usage and proliferation of each and every one of them.
If you want to browse all of Basho’s code, start with our [[GitHub Account|https://github.com/basho]]. Documentation for some of Basho's most frequently used other applications can be found below.
<br>

### Webmachine

Webmachine is an application layer that adds HTTP semantic awareness on top of the excellent bit-pushing and HTTP syntax-management provided by mochiweb. It provides a simple and clean way to connect that to your application’s behavior.  For an overview of Webmachine, see the [[Webmachine wiki page| http://wiki.basho.com/Webmachine.html]]

For source code and "quick start" instructions, see the [[Webmachine GitHub Repo|https://github.com/basho/webmachine]] and associated README.

To keep an eye on the daily issues, discussions, and community happenings, join the [[Webmachine Mailing List|http://lists.therestfulway.com/mailman/listinfo/webmachine_lists.therestfulway.com]].
<br>
### Rebar

Rebar is a tool that makes it easy to compile and test Erlang applications, port drivers, and releases.  Rebar also provides dependency management, enabling application writers to easily re-use common libraries from a variety of locations (git, hg, etc).

Documentation can be found in the [[Rebar Wiki|https://github.com/basho/rebar/wiki]].

Source code can be found in the [[Rebar GitHub Repo|https://github.com/basho/rebar]].

### Bitcask

Bitcask is an Erlang application that provides an API for storing and retrieving key/value data into a log-structured hash table that provides very fast access.  While originally developed to be used under Riak, it is generic and can be used for other applications.

For a good intro to Bitcask, see Basho's paper [['Bitcask: A Log-Structured Hash Table for Fast Key/Value Data'|http://downloads.basho.com/papers/bitcask-intro.pdf]].

Documentation can be found on the [[Bitcask Wiki Page|http://wiki.basho.com/Bitcask.html]].

Get the Bitcask source code in the [[Bitcask GitHub Repo|https://github.com/basho/bitcask]].
