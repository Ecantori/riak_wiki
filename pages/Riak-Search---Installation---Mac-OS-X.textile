The following steps should get you up and running with Riak Search on Mac OS X 10.5 or 10.6.

<div class="note"><div class="title">ulimit on OS X</div>OS X gives you a very small limit on open file handles, so even with a backend that uses very few file handles, it's possible to run out. See [[Open Files Limit]] for more information about changing the limit.</div>

h2. From Precompiled Tarballs

h3. 32-bit


```bash
$ curl -O http://downloads.basho.com/riak-search/riak-search-0.14/riak_search-0.14.0-osx-i386.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf riak_search-0.14.0-1-osx-i386.tar.gz
```

After the release is untared you will be able to cd into the riak_search directory and execute: 

```bash
$ bin/riaksearch start 
```

to start the Riak node.

h2. Source Install

You must have XCode tools installed from the CD that came with your Mac or from [[Apple's Developer website|http://developer.apple.com]].

Riak Search requires [[Erlang|http://www.erlang.org/]] R13B04 or later. If you do not have Erlang already installed, see [[Installing Erlang]].

Now we can download and install Riak Search:


```bash
wget http://downloads.basho.com/riak-search/riak-search-0.14/riak_search-0.14.0-1.tar.gz
tar zxvf riak_search-0.14.0-1.tar.gz
cd riak_search-0.14.0
make rel
```

There should now be a fresh build of Riak Search in the rel/riaksearch directory.

h2. Homebrew 

To install Riak Search using Homebrew:


```bash
$ brew install riak-search
```
