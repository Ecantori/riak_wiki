The following steps should get you up and running with Riak Search on Mac OS X 10.5 or 10.6.


<div class="note"><div class="title">ulimit on OS X</div>OS X gives you a very small limit on open file handles, so even with a backend that uses very few file handles, it's possible to run out.  Run this command before getting started developing on your Mac:

```bash
ulimit -n 1024
```
</div>


h2. Source Install

You must have XCode tools installed from the CD that came with your Mac or from [[Apple's Developer website|http://developer.apple.com]].

Riak Search requires [[Erlang|http://www.erlang.org/]] R13B04 or later. If you do not have Erlang already installed, see [[Installing Erlang]].

Now we can download and install Riak Search:


```bash
wget http://downloads.basho.com/riak-search/riak-search-0.13/riak_search-0.13.0.tar.gz
tar zxvf riak_search-0.13.0.tar.gz
cd riak_search-0.13.0
make rel
```


There should now be a fresh build of Riak Search in the rel/riaksearch directory.
